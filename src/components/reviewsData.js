    text:"I cannot rave about Hailey. She is an absolute GEM of a human. She is so kind, and truly cares about every one of her clients. She goes above and beyond to get to know the pups and their parents. Our Weimardoodle was just experiencing bad grooming luck until we met her. Our lab doesnâ€™t think twice about going right to her, even for nail trims and grinding. Our pups adore her and so do we!",
